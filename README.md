1.06 patch notes

-disabled saving/loading during the enemy turn. instead, a warning will appear.

-fixed possible crash caused by Vanguard cannon when used to kill a boss (and other units)

-darkend the background during victory screen and destroyed units don't suddenly pop up anymore

-increases size of HP and EN values in status window

-"end turn' button shows red if there are ships with full energy left. it shows green when there are none. 
I think a confirmation popup would be too invasive.

-fixed transition glitch at the end of mission 2

-pressing [ or ] now cycles through player ships. if you start a new game on 1.06 then the middle mouse 
button will also work.

-lowered the default volume of music

-right click deselects weapon or ship (new game required)

-added experimental option for edge scrolling.
