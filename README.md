Sunrider
========

preliminary work on beta 3
--------------------------

changed:
* enemy phoenix is immune to blind side attacks
* changed EN upgrades to go in units of 5 (thanks ledabot)
* fixed not being able to use a weapon because game didn't check for cost upgrades when deciding when a button is clickable
* accuracy upgrades affect a weapons base accuracy, which overall makes these upgrades more effective and easier to understand.


patch notes 2.1
---------------

*fixed*:

  * missiles deducting energy cost twice
  * bonus menu
  * not being able to load from the main menu after credits
  * pulse weapons always missing on the pirate base (still only does minimal damage)
  * pirate bombers can now be attacked by melee
  * game crash when attacking the phoenix with the booster attached with a melee attack
  * fixed flak no longer working after shooting down all the missiles in a salvo.
  * player ships sometimes counter attack twice
  * added 2 cruisers in mission 8 to make it harder to end the battle prematurely.
 
*balance changes*:

  * vanguard cannon now costs 1500 command points
  * upgrading maximum EN is significantly more expensive
  * upgrading EN costs of specific weapon types is slightly less expensive (over time)
  * Tactical nuclear warheads have become cheaper and more powerful. 300$ for 800 damage. recommended against (pirate) bases!
  * you can only use 1 order per turn

beta 2 v2.00
------------

* 3 new missions, 1 new unit and 1 new character and lots of story!
* added melee attacks and created dynamic animations for them  
* blind side attacks. any unit moving right next to another unit will get counter attacked by assault type weapons
* upgrading is completely overhauled and much morefunctional
* AI slightly modified

Beta 1
========
1.06 patch notes

-disabled saving/loading during the enemy turn. instead, a warning will appear.

-fixed possible crash caused by Vanguard cannon when used to kill a boss (and other units)

-darkend the background during victory screen and destroyed units don't suddenly pop up anymore

-increases size of HP and EN values in status window

-"end turn' button shows red if there are ships with full energy left. it shows green when there are none. 
I think a confirmation popup would be too invasive.

-fixed transition glitch at the end of mission 2

-pressing [ or ] now cycles through player ships. if you start a new game on 1.06 then the middle mouse 
button will also work.

-lowered the default volume of music

-right click deselects weapon or ship (new game required)

-added experimental option for edge scrolling.

1.06a

-fixed crash after killing a boss

-hopefully really fixed the Vanguard crash issue

-fixed crash when clicking middle mouse while selecting an enemy

-right click exits the save menu screen

-middle click will select the sunrider if no units are selected.

1.06b 

-fixed bug introduced by commenting out some critical code
